### 🌐 About Me  
I'm passionate about creating **business value through engineering** — whether it's cutting costs, improving performance, or enabling new capabilities. I specialize in building **reliable, resilient, and scalable distributed microservice systems** in the cloud, with a strong focus on **observability, automation, and maintainability**.

I enjoy solving **complex and novel problems**, from designing clean service architectures to optimizing infrastructure spend through efficient use of IaC (Terraform/Pulumi), serverless, and autoscaling solutions.

I believe in:
- Engineering that ties directly to measurable business impact  
- Reliability and visibility from day one (alerting, logging, metrics)  
- Providing guidance, making pragmatic decisions, and staying a lifelong student of the craft
